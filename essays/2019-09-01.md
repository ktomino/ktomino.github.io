I decided to pursure Management Information Systems because I was looking for a second major and MIS and marketing go well together. Through the skills that I learn in the ITM classes, I think I will be able to utilize those skills in whatever marketing path I take. I like the creative side of marketing and thus might be able to use both hand in hand to create marketing collateral or software that might make my life more efficient.
