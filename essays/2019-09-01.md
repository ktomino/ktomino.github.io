title: Why MIS?
Why I Chose MIS
date: 2019-09-01
labels: essay

My name is Kristina Tomino and I am currently a junior intending on majoring in Management Information Systems and Marketing. In my free time, I like to watch tv shows and some of my favorites are Gossip Girl, Gray's Anatomy, and Brooklyn 99. I also like to browse around YouTube and watch home makeover and interior design videos. 

I decided to pursure Management Information Systems because I was looking for a second major and MIS and marketing go well together. Through the skills that I learn in the ITM classes, I think I will be able to utilize those skills in whatever marketing path I take. I like the creative side of marketing and thus might be able to use both hand in hand to create marketing collateral or software that might make my life more efficient. Ideally, I would like to end up with a job in event coordinating, and I might be able to utilize programming through making my own website or helping my potential clients make websites for their respective events.
